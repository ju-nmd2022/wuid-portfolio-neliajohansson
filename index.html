          My name is Cornelia - also known as Nelia - and I'm 24 years old. I am
          a New Media Design student at Jönköping University and have lived in
          <a href="jonkoping.html">Jönköping</a>
          my whole life. I am a barista currently working at a local coffee
          shop, and when I'm not studying this is where I spend most of my time.
          Apart from latte art, I am also interested in everything else that has
          to do with art and being creative.
        </p>
        <h3>This includes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>photography</li>
          <li>videography</li>
          <li>photo/video editing</li>
          <li>illustrating</li>
          <li>painting</li>
          <li>writing</li>
          <li>and designing <em>anything</em> really</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Apart from this I also have a great passion for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>food</li>
          <li>traveling</li>
          <li>reading</li>
          <li>and everything surrounding music</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The latter resulting in me knowing how to play both the piano, drums,
          and guitar. But back to the important. I have in between graduating
          from high school and starting uni taken some useful courses somewhat
          related to the things we will work on within the NMD program.
        </p>

        <h3>These include courses in</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>photography</li>
          <li>media production</li>
          <li>and marketing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also have many years of experience working in Photoshop and
          Lightroom. Although I've never worked with any other Adobe softwares
          before, I have many years of experience working in Procreate and Final
          Cut Pro X instead, as well as a tiny bit experience working with
          webdesign and html/css.
          <br />
          In the future my goal is to be able to work as a freelancing
          illustrator and graphic designer leaning in to many different areas of
          the designer field. Therefore, I am really looking forward to learn
          more about graphic design and web design while finding my own style
          and building my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.
